# flappy-dird
An implementation of flappy bird in MacOS's Finder.

To play:
* Clone the repo
* Run `flap.py first-time-setup` (`flap.py` has no dependencies)
* Open a Finder window
* Run `osascript ./flapy-dird.applescript`
* Find the Finder window you opened, play the game.

I will very happily take pull requests if they add new functionality, fix bugs, or are funny.

Gameplay:
